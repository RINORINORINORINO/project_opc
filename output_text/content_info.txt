As Easter approaches, pet owners are reminded to keep chocolate and certain candies away from dogs, as they can be extremely toxic. Chocolate contains theobromine, which is harmful to dogs and can lead to serious health issues, while xylitol, found in many candies, is deadly even in small amounts. To safely include pets in Easter festivities, consider creating a dog-friendly Easter basket with treats specifically designed for dogs, such as marshmallow-flavored dog treats, peanut butter-flavored cookies, and engaging toys. By choosing pet-safe options, you can ensure a fun and safe holiday for your furry friends.
