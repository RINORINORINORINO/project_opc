[요약본]
To extend the life of your clothes, it's essential to follow care instructions, reduce washing frequency, use cold water, air dry, and store them properly. Consider using mesh laundry bags for delicates, carry stain-removing wipes for immediate spot treatment, and opt for a clothing steamer instead of an iron to avoid heat damage. Dryer balls can cut down on drying time and are a more eco-friendly option than dryer sheets. Proper storage with wooden or velvet hangers can also help maintain garment shape and prevent creases.
